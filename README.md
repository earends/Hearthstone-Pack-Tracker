# Hearthstone-Pack-Tracker

This project was for an independent study on C++ and wxWidgets. This project was meant to be compatible with the game hearthstone. Open packs in game, click the collect cards button and voila you now have new stats on all the new cards you just opneed. Stats such as  how many legendaries you have opened so far or the entire dust value of every pack you have opnened.
